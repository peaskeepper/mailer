Bulk Email Sender is a Python application that allows you to send emails to multiple recipients using your Outlook email account. It provides a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) for entering the necessary details, selecting recipient emails from an Excel file, and sending personalized emails.

## Features

- Sends personalized emails to multiple recipients
- Uses Outlook SMTP server for sending emails
- Supports specifying a delay between each email to avoid overwhelming the server
- Option to mark emails as urgent and important
- Provides a progress status for tracking the email sending process

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter module (included in the standard library)
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- openpyxl library (`pip install openpyxl`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies listed above.
2. Run the `bulk_email_sender.py` script using Python: `python bulk_email_sender.py`.
3. The application window will open.
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - "Sender Email": Enter your Outlook email address from which you want to send the emails.
   - "Sender Password": Enter the password for your Outlook account. Note: The application does not store or save your password.
   - "Subject": Enter the subject of the email.
   - "Message": Enter the body of the email.
5. Click on the "Recipient Emails (Excel)" field and browse your computer to select an Excel file (.xlsx) that contains the list of recipient emails. Ensure that the file has a column named "Email" containing the email addresses of the recipients.
6. Specify the delay between sending each email in seconds. This helps prevent overwhelming the email server. It is recommended to use a delay of a few seconds (e.g., 2-5 seconds).
7. (Optional) Check the "Mark as Urgent" checkbox if you want to mark the emails as urgent and important.
8. Click on the "Send Emails" button to start sending the emails.
9. The application will begin sending the emails one by one. The progress status label will display the progress, indicating which email is being sent.
10. Once all the emails have been sent, a success message will be displayed.

Note: It is important to ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that the Outlook account you provided has the necessary permissions to send emails.

## Important Notes

- The recipient emails should be provided in an Excel file (.xlsx) format, with a column named "Email" containing the email addresses of the recipients.
- The application uses the Outlook SMTP server to send emails. Therefore, you need to provide a valid Outlook email address and password.
- The application uses a delay between sending each email to avoid overwhelming the server. Please use this feature responsibly and consider the limitations of your email service provider.
- The application relies on the accuracy and consistency of the recipient email addresses. Ensure that the Excel file contains valid and accessible email addresses.
